# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in the C programming language.

## Introduction

In this project, you will find a wide range of data structures and algorithms implemented in C.

## Data Structures

The following data structures are currently implemented:

-   Singly Linked List
-   Doubly Linked List

Each data structure is organized in its own directory and contains the necessary C files.
